#### stuff I learned along the way
- Tauri converts all parameters used in JS calls to camelCase by default! Therefore if you have a `#[tauri::command]` in Rust whose function parameter name uses snake_case (as is the style recommendation by VS Code or rust-analyzer, for that matter), it is necessary that such `command`s are annotated in the following way: `#[tauri::command(rename_all = "snake_case")]` -- otherwise the invocation simply won't work with no particular error messages by default. An error message will, however, be displayed in the browser console.
